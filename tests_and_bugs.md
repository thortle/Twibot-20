## 2. Bugs and Issues Encountered

### 2.1. Data Processing Issues

#### 2.1.1. Empty Text Fields
- **Issue**: Some user profiles had empty or very short text fields
- **Impact**: Models trained on such data would have poor performance due to lack of features
- **Resolution**: Added text length statistics reporting to identify and handle empty text fields
- **Prevention**: Implemented checks for text length and reported statistics on empty fields

#### 2.1.2. ClassLabel Type Requirement
- **Issue**: When using `train_test_split` with `stratify_by_column`, the column must be a ClassLabel type, not a Value type
- **Impact**: Stratification would fail if the label column was not properly typed
- **Resolution**: Ensured that the label column was defined as a ClassLabel type with proper names
- **Prevention**: Added explicit type checking and conversion for the label column

#### 2.1.3. JSON Parsing Errors
- **Issue**: The Twibot-20 dataset JSON files were not in standard format and required special parsing
- **Impact**: Standard JSON loading would fail or produce incorrect results
- **Resolution**: Implemented custom JSON parsing logic to handle the specific format
- **Prevention**: Added robust error handling and validation for JSON parsing

### 2.2. Tokenization Issues

#### 2.2.1. Token Length Imbalance
- **Issue**: Some texts were very short after tokenization (â‰¤2 tokens)
- **Impact**: Models would struggle to learn from such limited features
- **Resolution**: Added reporting on token statistics to identify problematic samples
- **Prevention**: Implemented checks for token length and reported statistics on very short token sequences

#### 2.2.2. Truncation of Long Texts
- **Issue**: Some texts exceeded the model's maximum input length (512 tokens for DistilBERT)
- **Impact**: Information loss due to truncation could affect model performance
- **Resolution**: Implemented truncation with appropriate warnings
- **Prevention**: Added reporting on the number of samples that required truncation

### 2.3. Model Training Issues

#### 2.3.1. Device Detection Errors
- **Issue**: Incorrect device detection could lead to training failures
- **Impact**: Training would fail or be unnecessarily slow on incompatible devices
- **Resolution**: Implemented robust device detection logic for CPU, CUDA, and MPS (Apple Silicon)
- **Prevention**: Added clear reporting of the detected device and fallback mechanisms

#### 2.3.2. Memory Usage Spikes
- **Issue**: Training on large datasets could cause memory usage spikes
- **Impact**: System could become unresponsive or crash due to excessive memory usage
- **Resolution**: Implemented batch size controls and memory monitoring
- **Prevention**: Added memory usage reporting and optimized batch sizes

### 2.4. Parquet Conversion Issues

#### 2.4.1. Feature Type Preservation
- **Issue**: Converting between formats could lose feature type information
- **Impact**: Models would fail if feature types were incorrect
- **Resolution**: Implemented explicit feature type preservation during conversion
- **Prevention**: Added validation of feature types after conversion

#### 2.4.2. Sequence Column Handling
- **Issue**: Sequence columns (like `input_ids` and `attention_mask`) required special handling in Parquet
- **Impact**: Tokenized datasets could fail to convert correctly
- **Resolution**: Implemented special handling for sequence columns in Parquet conversion
- **Prevention**: Added specific type checking and conversion for sequence columns

## 4. Lessons Learned

1. **Data Quality Matters**: Empty or very short text fields can significantly impact model performance. Always check and report data quality statistics.

2. **Type Safety**: Ensure proper type definitions, especially for operations like stratified splitting that have specific type requirements.

3. **Memory Management**: Large datasets require careful memory management. Implement incremental processing and strategic garbage collection.

4. **Format Efficiency**: Apache Parquet provides significant benefits for storage, loading, and processing efficiency compared to the default Hugging Face format.

5. **Device Compatibility**: Robust device detection and compatibility logic is essential for models to work across different hardware configurations.
